This is my personal website. Here I write blogs, add code snippets, code live demos, and add resources for everybody else to look and refer.

The application is built with **Next.js/React/MDX** and friends

## Overview

- `pages/api/*` - API routes for the [`Dashboard`](https://manuarora.in/dashboard). Contains Twitter, Spotify, and Google Analytics APIs.

- `pages/blog/*` - Static pages rendered using MDX

- `pages/resources` - [Resources](https://manuarora.in/resources) page

- `pages/snippets` - [Snippets](https://manuarora.in/snippets) page to see all the ready to use code snippets.

- `pages/tweets` - my favourite [Tweets](https://manuarora.in/tweets) from the twitter world.

- `pages/*` - All other static pages.

# Inspiration

Special thanks to [Lee Rob](https://github.com/leerob) for creating such a beautiful theme that is very well structured and looks amazing on all devices. All the design inspiration and MDX structure come from him.

If you're interested in learning Next.js and building real-world applications with it, I strongly suggest taking Lee's course [React 2025](https://react2025.com). I have taken it myself and can vouch for it.
