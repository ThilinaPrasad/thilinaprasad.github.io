Recently, There is a lot of demand of Javascript developers out there. If you're familiar with `React` and `Angular` then that will be a plus for you. But if you fail to answer the basics of JavaScript, you will have a tough time clearing the Tech Interview rounds of the companies for which you're appearing.

I've compiled down all the popular concepts and questions related to a Javascript Interview. No matter at what level of understanding you're currently at, this will help you out.

<div id="array-methods">
  <StepLargeCustom number="1" title="Array Methods" />
</div>

Questions around array methods revolve around different array functions that are being used on a day to day basis.

- <HighlightBox>map()</HighlightBox>
- <HighlightBox>filter()</HighlightBox>
- <HighlightBox>reduce()</HighlightBox>
- <HighlightBox>forEach()</HighlightBox>
- <HighlightBox>find()</HighlightBox>

### map()

map() iterates over an array and returns a new array based on the condition provided.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example:</strong>
</HighlightBox> The following iterates over an array of numbers and returns a new
array - in which every number is multiplied by 2.

```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = myArray.map((arrayElement) => arrayElement * 2);
console.log(newArray); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### filter()

Filter does exactly what it says, filters out the elements from an array. Based on the condition, one can filter out the elements from an array.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example:</strong>
</HighlightBox> The following iterates over an array of numbers and filters the array
in such a way that if the number is greater than 4, only then it is kept. Results
are stored in a new array.

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let newArray = myArray.filter((arrayElement) => arrayElement > 4);
console.log(newArray); // [5]
```

### reduce()

reduce() is a powerful method which can be used to reduce the values of array to one single element. Values get accumulated over each iteration and at the end, we are left with a single value / element.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example:</strong>
</HighlightBox>
Sum all the numbers of the array numbers = [1, 2, 3] and return the result

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>with reduce()</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current);

console.log(sum); // 10
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>without reduce()</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  sum += numbers[i];
}

console.log(sum); // 10
```

It reduced 3 steps for calculating the sum to just 1 step.

### forEach()

This is the simplest to understand method. It simply iterates over the array and performs whichever condition is specified.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example:</strong>
</HighlightBox>
Iterate over the numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] array and check if it is even or odd.

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((number) =>
  number % 2 === 0 ? console.log("even") : console.log("odd")
);
```

Note: `forEach()` doesn't return a new array.

### find()

find() method takes in a callback function which checks the condition while iterating over every element of the array and returns the `first` match.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example:</strong>
</HighlightBox>
Check the age of the person in the ages array. ages = [12, 32, 42, 22, 13], if the
age is greater than 18 then accept the first match, otherwise return.

```js
let ages = [12, 32, 42, 22, 13];

const checkAge = (age) => {
  return age > 18;
};

let result = ages.find(checkAge);
console.log(result); // 32
```

Note: The difference between `indexOf` and `find()` is that `find()` returns the element, while `indexOf` returns the index at which the element is present.

## Difference Between map() and forEach()

<StepCheck title="Method chaining can be done in map() but not in forEach()" />
<StepCheck title="map() returns a new Array, forEach() doesn't return a new array" />
<StepCheck title="both of the methods don't mutate the original array" />

<Divider />

<div id="var-let-const">
  <StepLargeCustom number="2" title="Var, Let and Const" />
</div>

### <HighlightBox>var</HighlightBox>

<StepCheck title="var is globally and functionally scoped - meaning it is accessible throughout your script or within a function" />

```js
var text = "Hey bruh!";

function newFunction() {
  var textNew = "hello";
}
console.log(textNew); // error: textNew is not defined
```

Here, error is generated `textNew` is not defined because `textNew` is declared within a function, and it is not accessible outside the function scope. While `text` can be accessed outside because it is declared outside.

<StepCheck title="var variables can be re-declared and re updated. It can be declared without initialization" />

```js
var text = "hey bruh";
var text = "Helloooooooo!";

var text; // valid
```

### <HighlightBox>let</HighlightBox>

`let` is now the preferred way of declaring and initializing variables in JavaScript.

<StepCheck title="let is block scoped. A block is a chunk of code covered by {}. Variables defined by let are only accessible within a block of code." />

```js
let text = "Hi Manu!";

let length = 10;

if (length > 5) {
  let welcome = "Hi Manu, welcome to block scope";
  console.log(welcome);
}

console.log(welcome); // Error
```

<StepCheck title="let can be updated, but it cannot be re-declared within the same scope" />

```js
let text = "Hi Manu!";

text = "Please redeclare me!"; // error: text has already been declared
```

But here is a catch, <HighlightBox>If the variable is defined in different scopes, there will be no error.</HighlightBox>

```js
let text = "Hi Manu";
if (true) {
  let text = "Hello Paaji!";
  console.log(text); // "Hello Paaji!"
}
console.log(text); // "Hi Manu"
```

### <HighlightBox>const</HighlightBox>

Variables declared with `const` maintain a constant value. They share some similarities with `let`.

<StepCheck title="const declarations are block scoped, just like let. They can be accessed within a block only." />
<StepCheck title="const declarations cannot be updated or re-declared" />

```js
const text = "Hi";
text = "say bye"; // error: Assignment to constant variable.
```

```js
const text = "Hi";
const text = "say bye"; // error: text has already been declared
```

<StepCheck title="const declarations must be initialized at the time of declaration" />

```js
const text; // error
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Note:</strong>
</HighlightBox> The interviewer might ask the difference between the three. Other
popular questions revolving around var let and const cover Hoisting, which is discussed
below.

<Divider />

<div id="hoisting">
  <StepLargeCustom number="3" title="Hoisting" />
</div>

> Hoisting is a mechanism of JavaScript where variables and function declarations
> are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

No matter where the function and variables are declared, they are moved at <HighlightBox>the top of their scope</HighlightBox> whether their scope is global or local.

<StepCheck title="var is hoisted at the top of the scope and initialized with undefined" />

```js
console.log(counter); // undefined var counter = 1;
```

Here, undefined will be printed, no error will be shown.

<StepCheck title="let is hoisted at the top of the scope and is not initialized at all." />

```js
console.log(counter);
let counter = 1; // Reference error - counter is not initialized.
```

Here, `Reference error` will be thrown because the `counter` variable is not initialized.

<StepCheck title="Functions hoisting - Hoisted at the top" />

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example: Before hoisting</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js let x = 1, y = 2;
let result = add(x, y);
console.log(result);

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Example: After hoisting</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let x = 20,
  y = 10;

let result = add(x, y);
console.log(result);
```

<Divider />

<div id="double-vs-triple">
  <StepLargeCustom number="4" title="== vs ===" />
</div>
In simple terms, `==` doesn't check the type while `===` checks the type before comparing.

<HighlightBox>Example: ==</HighlightBox>

```js
let number = 1;
let str = "1";

console.log(number == str); // true
```

<HighlightBox>Example: ===</HighlightBox>

```js
let number = 1;
let str = "1";

console.log(number === str); // false
```

In more precise terms: <HighlightBox>== converts both the values to the same type and then compares</HighlightBox> where as <HighlightBox>=== strictly checks for equality, which is, same type and content.</HighlightBox>

<Divider />

<div id="this-keyword">
  <StepLargeCustom number="5" title="this Keyword" />
</div>

> The `this` keyword references the object of which the function is a property of.
> In simple words, the `this` keyword references the object that is currently calling
> the function

<HighlightBox>Example:</HighlightBox>

```js
let car = {
  brand: "BMW",
  getBrand: function () {
    return this.brand;
  },
};

console.log(car.getBrand()); // BMW
```

Here, the output is `BMW` because the method `getBrand()` is called where `this.brand` is being returned. Now, `this` refers to the object car; and hence, `this.brand` refers to `car.brand` and `BMW` is returned.

<Divider />

<div id="call-apply-bind">
  <StepLargeCustom number="6" title="call(), apply() and bind()" />
</div>
In JavaScript, we have various ways for binding `this` to a function.

1. <HighlightBox>
     <strong>Default Binding</strong>{" "}
   </HighlightBox> - `this` points to global scope.
2. <HighlightBox>
     <strong>Implicitly</strong>
   </HighlightBox> - using dot notation

```js
function fun() {
  console.log(this);
}

const obj = {
  counter: 1,
  fun: fun,
};

obj.fun();
// {counter: 1, fun: ƒ}. that is: obj
```

3. <HighlightBox>
     <strong>Explicitly</strong>
   </HighlightBox> - Force a function to use an object at their `this` place. Here,
   We have three options: `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>call():</strong>{" "}
</HighlightBox>

Pass in the required object as the first parameter during function call, The actual
parameters are passed after the object, one after the other

```js
function fun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(this);
}

const obj = {
  counter: 1,
};

const param1 = 1,
  param2 = 2;
fun.call(obj, param1, param2); // {counter: 1} - the obj is binded with fun() method
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>apply(): </strong>
</HighlightBox>

Pretty much same as `call()`, only difference is that parameters are passed as an
array.

```js
function fun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(this);
}

const obj = {
  counter: 1,
};

const param1 = 1,
  param2 = 2;
fun.apply(obj, [param1, param2]); // {counter: 1} - the obj is binded with fun() method
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>bind():</strong>{" "}
</HighlightBox>

A new function is created where we explicitly bind the `this` which is fixed. Also
known as bound functions.

```js
function fun() {
  console.log(this);
}

const obj = {
  counter: 1,
};

const boundFunction = fun.bind(obj);
boundFunction(); // {counter: 1}
```

<div id="local-storage-session-storage">
  <StepLargeCustom number="7" title="Local Storage and Session Storage" />
</div>
Both mechanisms are used to <HighlightBox>persist data</HighlightBox> in the browser
level.

### Local Storage

<StepCheck title="Data is not lost even after the browser is closed, or even after the OS is rebooted." />

```js
localStorage.setItem("name", "Manu"); // set an item
localStorage.getItem("name"); // retrieve the data
localStorage.removeItem("key"); // remove data
```

### Session Storage

<StepCheck title="Data is persisted over a session. i.e. Data will be lost if the browser is closed" />

```js
sessionStorage.user = {
  name: "Manu",
};
```

<Divider />

<div id="timers-setTimeout-setInterval">
  <StepLargeCustom number="8" title="Timers - setTimeout() and setInterval()" />
</div>
The concepts are simple - Questions around these topics are tricky.

### setTimeout()

The method calls a function after a specified duration of time has passed.

```js
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Manu");
}, 2000);
```

Here, "Manu" is logged after 2 seconds.

### setInterval()

This method calls a function over and over again within a specific interval of time.

```js
setInterval(function () {
  console.log("Manu");
}, 2000);
```

Here, "Manu" is printed every 2 seconds.
`clearInterval()` is used to stop the setInterval() method.

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Output Based Questions on Timers: </strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
console.log("1");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2");
}, 0);
console.log("3");

//Answer:  "1" "3" "2"
```

```js
// interviewer: what will the following code output?
const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("Index: " + i + ", element: " + arr[i]);
  }, 3000);
}

// Output: '4 undefined' Printed 4 times.
```

In the above question:

- Loop is executed and initial conditions are checked.
- setTimeout() is not called -> defered to call stack(more on event loop later)
- `i` value is incremented and keeps on iterating.
- Loop breaks, `i` = 4 and finally setTimeout() function is executed.
- Since `i` = 4, Index: 4 is printed and since `arr[4]` does not exist, `undefined` is printed.
- This executes for 4 times since the setTimeout() was called 4 times.

  <StepLargeCustom number="9" title="Polyfills" />
</div>

> A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern
> functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

For Example, The interviewer might ask you to implement your own `text-shadow` from scratch property or some property which is not supported by old browsers.

Most commonly asked function implementations are: map(), forEach(), filter(), reduce(), bind()

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Implementing forEach() from scratch</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
Array.prototype.myForEach = function (callback) {
  // callback here is the callback function
  // which actual .forEach() function accepts
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    callback(this[i], i, this); // currentValue, index, array
  }
};

let arr = ["Moosetape", "BDFU", "Godzilla"];
arr.myForEach((item) => console.log(item));
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Implementing map() from scratch</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  var arr = []; // since, we need to return an array
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    arr.push(callback(this[i], i, this)); // pushing currentValue, index, array
  }
  return arr; // finally returning the array
};

let arr = ["Moosetape", "BDFU", "Godzilla"];
const result = arr.myMap((item) => console.log(item));
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Implementing filter() from scratch</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callback, context) {
  arr = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (callback.call(context, this[i], i, this)) {
      arr.push(this[i]);
    }
  }
  return arr;
};

let arr = [
  { name: "Moosetape", songs: 20 },
  { name: "BDFU", songs: 7 },
  { name: "Godzilla", songs: 11 },
];
arr.myFilter(function (album) {
  return arr.songs > 11; // providing the context here
});
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Implementing reduce() from scratch</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
Array.prototype.myReduce = function (callback, initialValue) {
  var accumulator = initialValue === undefined ? undefined : initialValue;

  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (accumulator !== undefined) {
      accumulator = callback.call(undefined, accumulator, this[i], i, this);
    } else {
      accumulator = this[i];
    }
  }
  return accumulator;
};

let arr = ["Moosetape", "BDFU", "Godzilla"];

let results = arr.myReduce(function (a, b) {
  return a + " " + b;
}, "Tape - ");

console.log(results);
```

<HighlightBox>
  <strong>Implementing bind() from scratch</strong>
</HighlightBox>

```js
let name = {
  first: "Sidhu",
  last: "Moosewala",
};
let display = function () {
  console.log(`${this.first} ${this.last}`);
};

Function.prototype.myBind = function (...args) {
  // this -> display
  let obj = this;
  return function () {
    obj.call(args[0]);
  };
};

let displayMe = display.myBind(name);

displayMe(); // Sidhu Moosewala

This is a big one. 🥺

> The event loop's job is to look at the stack and look at the task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushed it on to the stack.

Now what does this even mean? Let's have a look.

Javascript is a <HighlightBox>Single-Threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language.</HighlightBox> Which means it only has one call stack, one memory area.

What makes JavaScript special is the addition things that the browser provides (Web APIs, Callback Queues and the event loop). But Natively, JavaScript just has 2 things, i.e. Heaps and Call Stack.

- Call Stack: A data Structure where function calls get stacked
- Heap: A Memory area from where the memory is allocated to processes.

Now, We need to make sure the code that we are writing is <strong>non-blocking</strong>. Non-blocking essentially means that the code is not stopping the components to wait or render for some other request.

<HighlightBox>Example: </HighlightBox>

Consider this piece of code:

```js
function third(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function second(n) {
  return third(n, n);
}

function first() {
  var element = second(7);
  console.log(element);
}

first();
```

Iterating over the Code:

- `main()` function is called natively by Javascript, it gets pushed on to the call stack.
- `main()` calls `first()` method, `first()` method gets pushed onto the call stack.
- `first()` function calls the `second()` function, `second()` function gets onto the call stack.
- `second()` function calls the `third()` function, `third()` function gets onto the call stack.
- `third()` function executes and returns `a + b`. After that, it gets popped off the stack.
- Similarly, everything gets popped off the stack.

This stacking and removing from the stack can be blocked by some bad code that we write, or for that matter, some time consuming API calls can slow down the process (async code). To cater that, we have web APIs. Let's take an example.

```js
console.log("Event Loop");
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("is awesome");
}, 1000);
console.log("but sometimes confusing");

/* output: 
Event Loop 
but sometimes confusing 
is awesome.
*/
```

Now why is that? Let's understand.

- `main()` is called, gets onto the call stack.
- `main()` calls `console.log()` method, it gets on top of the stack.
- `console.log()` gets executed, it gets removed from the top of the stack. We move on to the next line. -> 'Event Loop' is printed.
- `setTimeout()` is called. Since setTimeout() is an `asynchronous` piece of code, it gets removed from the stack and get into the Web APIs module. In Web APIs module, the timer for `setTimeout()` runs. When the timer for `setTimeout()` is over, the `Callback` function of the setTimeout() gets into the `Callback Queue`.
- While this is happening, The call stack is empty and it keeps on executing the lines.
- `console.log()` is pushed onto the stack and executed. -> 'But Sometimes Confusing' is printed
- Now since the execution is done completely and the function block is finished. Event loop checks the stack.
- If the stack is empty, event loop picks the first available function from the `Callback Queue` and pushed it into the stack.
- Here, `Callback` for `setTimeout()` gets pushed onto the stack i.e. `console.log()`. -> 'is awesome' is printed.

Event loop's task is to essentially check the stack, if it is empty, put the callback queue's function on the stack and repeat this entire process.

> A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred).

States of a promise:

- fulfilled - When the promise is `resolve()` ed.
- rejected - When the promises is `reject()` ed.
- pending - When the promise is still processing.

```js
const wait = (time) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time));

wait(3000)
  .then(() => console.log("Hi Paaji!"))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err)); // 'Hi Paaji!'
```

We can chain `.then()` and `.catch()` methods on promises.

<div id="async-await">
  <StepLargeCustom number="12" title="Async / Await" />
</div>
> First of all we have the async keyword, which you put in front of a function declaration
to turn it into an async function. An async function is a function that knows how
to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous
code.

> The advantage of an async function only becomes apparent when you combine it with the await keyword. await only works inside async functions within regular JavaScript code, however it can be used on its own with JavaScript modules.

Long story short:

- Async Await can be used to handle asynchronous code in a much cleaner and smaller way.
- The return value of Async functions are always Promises that can be `await`ed and results can be generated.

```js
// returns a promise
let hello = async () => {
  return "Hello";
};

// Chain a .then() to get the value
hello().then((value) => console.log(value));
```

```js
let apiCall = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("someapi.cpom/json");

  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Code Failed, Boo!");

  return response;
};
apiCall();
```

<div id="closures">
  <StepLargeCustom number="13" title="Closures" />
</div>

> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references
> to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives
> you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures
> are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Before undersanding closures, lets understand <HighlightBox>Lexical Scope</HighlightBox>

```js
function start() {
  var name = "Manu"; // name is a local variable created by start()
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a `closure`
    alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
start(); // "Manu" alert box is displayed
```

Here:

- `displayName()` method is an inner function, which is only available inside the body of `start()` method
- Interesting fact is that the method `displayName()` knows that there is a variable `name` OUTSIDE of the `displayName()`'s body. This is because inner functions have access to the parent's variables and methods.

Coming back to <HighlightBox><strong>Closures</strong></HighlightBox>

```js
function startClosure() {
  var name = "Manu";
  function displayName() {
    alert(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

var fun = startClosure();
fun(); // "Manu" is alerted
```

Precisely, A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
Which means, That an inner function will know the it's surroundings, i.e. the parent scope and the collective `thing` is called a closure.

Here,
The instance of displayName maintains a reference to its lexical environment, within which the variable name exists. For this reason, when fun() is invoked, the variable name remains available for use, and "Manu" is passed to alert.

Javascript implicitly / internally puts the `__proto__` object. When we craete anything like a function or an object, Javascript add the **proto** object to it with properties and methods.

### Prototypal Inheritance

In Javascript, we achieve OOPs inheritance through Prototypes.

```js
let firstObject = {
  name: "Manu",
  programming: "Next.js",
  age: 21,

  welcome: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} write in ${this.programming}`);
  },
};

let secondObject = {
  name: "Leo",
  age: 24,
};

secondObject.__proto__ = firstObject;

console.log(secondObject.programming);
```

<div id="debouncing">
  <StepLargeCustom number="14" title="Debouncing" />
</div>

> Debouncing precisely is delaying some operation so that it is not called on every iteration instantly.

Explaining the above statement: Debouce is used when one wants to delay some operation with some specific amount of time.

Lets take an example:

<HighlightBox>Codesandbox:</HighlightBox>{" "}

[Manu Arora's create username debounce
example](https://codesandbox.io/s/proud-surf-uiu2v?file=/src/index.js)

```js
import "./styles.css";
let inputEle = document.getElementById("inputElement");
let username = document.getElementById("username");

let generateUsername = (e) => {
  username.innerHTML = e.target.value.split(" ").join("-");
};

inputEle.addEventListener("keyup", generateUsername, 300);
```

The above code takes in names, splits and joins with a hyphen, and prints the new string as a username.

The native behaviour will be to spit out on every keyup, which is browser heavy task if implemented in a large scale system.

Instead, what can be done is we can have debouncing in place. Debounce method takes in a delay, which infact, will delay the time between each keystroke (here, it'll be 300 ms) and only then the next request will be processed.

```js
import "./styles.css";
let inputEle = document.getElementById("inputElement");
let username = document.getElementById("username");

let generateUsername = (e) => {
  username.innerHTML = e.target.value.split(" ").join("-");
};
let debounce = function (cb, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function () {
    let context = this;
    clearTimeout(timer); // to clear any previous timeouts - no accumulating garbage here in my world! ;)
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      cb.apply(context, arguments);
    }, delay);
  };
};

inputEle.addEventListener("keyup", debounce(generateUsername, 300));
```

We also `clearInterval()` to avoid unnecessary memory leaks.

Long story short: GetUsernames will be called on keyup - but only if there is a 300ms delay between each keystroke.
